# Markdown

### What is Markdown?

  - Markdown is a markup language for creating documents.
    - Simple Syntax (see below)
    - Can be converted to different documents (e.g. pdf, html, word,...).
    - Used by R, Jupyter, Gihub, etc...
    - Think of it as a streamlined version of latex.
    - We made this presentation using Markdown!

### How to work with markdown

  - R Studio supports R-Markdown.
  - Consists of a markdown file ('*.Rmd').
  - Very good documentation [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
  - Can be knitted in R Studio or converted using pandoc.


### Anatomy of a markdown file

```
---
title: "My Document"
output: html_document
author: "name"
date: "date"
---
```
- multitude of options:
  - ```output: beamer_presentation, word_document, pdf_document```
  - See documentation for more
- preamble followed by content
  

### Headers

```
# Header 1

## Header 1.1

### Header 1.1.1
```

### Lists

```
1. item 1
2. item 2

- item 1
  - subitem
- item 2
```

### Formatting

```
**bold**, *italic*, `monospace`, 
```

**bold**, *italic*, `monospace`

### Tables

```
|city      |population|
|----------|----------|
|Tilburg   |   211648 |
|Amsterdam |   821752 |
```
This gives:

|city      |population|
|----------|----------|
|Tilburg   |   211648 |
|Amsterdam |   821752 |

### Formulas

- Markdown allows to use Latex code for formulas:

```
in-line formula: $f(x)  = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$
```

in-line formula:  $f(x)  = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$

or below text:
```
\[2 = \lim_{n\righarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n\frac{1}{2^i}\]
```

\[2 = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n\frac{1}{2^i}\]


### Inclusions

```

image: ![Image](image.png "image")
```

### Including R code

- R markdown also allows to directly include r code

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%'}
attach(mtcars)

plot(wt, mpg, main="Scatterplot Example", 
   xlab="Car Weight ", ylab="Miles Per Gallon ")
```

# Git & Github


### Git

- Git is a language to track versions of documents. (distributed version control system)
- Imagine working on a word document for a long time.
  - How do you make sure to know what you did?
  - You'd create periodical backups.
  - But this is not very efficient!
- Instead version management:
  - Start with the initial commit.
  - Whenever you change something git only saves the changes.
  - You can access the current up-to-date document.
  - You can also access any previous version.
  - You see which line was changed!
  
### Github

  - You can run git on your own computer
  - or on specialized websites:
    - Github most popular. [https://github.com](https://github.com) 
    - many alternatives: [https://about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com) [https://bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org)
    - Github offers education accounts [https://education.github.com](https://education.github.com)
